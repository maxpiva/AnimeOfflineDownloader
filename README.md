## Under The hood


For proper hash identification, any randomization (date, segment, muxer version, etc) or different block ordering generated by the containers (mkv, mk4), are fixed or removed from the final files.

In layman's terms: If you download an episode, the final video archive created will be EXACTLY the same, if other user downloads the same episode, if both choose the same provider and resolution and archive type. 

Off course if the provider change the video encode or add/edit subtitles the final archive may change.

Some people may say that the nature of the streaming generate different files because the fluctuation of the bandwidth. It might be true for the player embedded in the sites, and devices, because it dynamically changes the bitrate and resolution depending of the network congestion. (The have internally multiple video files encoded at different bitrates and resolutions for the same episode and swap them on the fly depending of the congestion). But itâ€™s not true for this software since it only chose to download the video file at the desired bitrate and resolution from the provider.
