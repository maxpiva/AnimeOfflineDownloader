## Under The hood


For proper hash identification, any randomization (date, segment, muxer version, etc) or different block ordering generated by the containers (mkv, mk4), are fixed or removed from the final files.

In layman's terms: If you download An episode, the final video archive created with be EXACTLY the same, if other user download the same episode, if both choose the same provider and resolution and archive type. Offcourse if the provider change the video encode or add/edit subtitles the final archive may change. 

Some people may say that the nature of the streaming generate different files because the fluctuation of the bandwidth. It might be true for the player embedded in the sites, and devices, because it dinamically changes the bitrate and resolution depending of the network congestion. (The have internally multiple video files at different bitrates and resolution for the same episode and swap them on the fly). 
But its not true for this software since it download only the file at the desired bitrate and resolution.
